    "\n",
    "Build a secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent that sits over internal company data (wiki pages, Slack logs, emails, spreadsheets). Employees can ask natural-language questions; the agent retrieves relevant documents, answers with citations, and optionally performs safe tool calls (schedule meeting, fetch a doc, search Slack). The project emphasizes security, explainability, and integration-ready design."

    "## 📌 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Enterprise Knowledge Agent** — a next-generation RAG system designed to securely interface with an organization's **private data sources** like:\n",
    "- 📘 Internal wiki pages  \n",
    "- 💬 Slack logs and chat histories  \n",
    "- 📧 Emails and meeting summaries  \n",
    "- 📊 Excel sheets and reports  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the latest **LangChain**, **Groq LLM**, and **FAISS vector search**, this system enables employees to:\n",
    "> Ask natural-language questions, get cited answers, and even trigger safe tool actions like scheduling meetings or locating files.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Key Features\n",
    "- 🧾 **Multi-source ingestion:** Process text, markdown, emails, spreadsheets, and Slack logs.  \n",
    "- 🔍 **Vectorized RAG retrieval:** Search semantically across your organization’s private corpus.  \n",
    "- 🧠 **LLM reasoning with citation:** Each answer is backed by retrieved evidence.  \n",
    "- ⚙️ **Secure tool integration:** Perform simulated safe actions (schedule, lookup, post).  \n",
    "- 📊 **Interactive dashboards:** Visualize queries, sources, and confidence scores.  \n",
    "- 🔐 **Privacy-first design:** Role-based behavior, redaction demos, and encryption simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧰 Tech Stack\n",
    "- **LangChain** for orchestration  \n",
    "- **Groq API** for LLM inference (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`)  \n",
    "- **FAISS** for vector storage  \n",
    "- **SentenceTransformers** for embeddings  \n",
    "- **pandas**, **pdfplumber**, **plotly**, **spacy** for data handling and visualization  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Expected Outcome\n",
    "By the end of this project, you’ll have:\n",
    "- A working **Enterprise RAG Agent** capable of answering employee-style queries  \n",
    "- Fully cited responses with relevant document snippets  \n",
    "- A foundation for integrating into **real-world enterprise environments**  \n",
