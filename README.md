# Enterprise-Knowledge-Agent-Private-RAG-System-for-Company-Data
A secure, enterprise-grade AI assistant that connects to internal data (wiki, Slack logs, emails, spreadsheets) using a RAG pipeline built with LangChain, FAISS, and Groq LLMs — enabling intelligent Q&amp;A, document lookup, and business tool integration.

# 🧠 Enterprise Knowledge Agent – Private RAG System for Company Data

### 🔍 Overview
The **Enterprise Knowledge Agent** is an advanced, private Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for real-world enterprise data.  
It allows organizations to query their **internal knowledge base** — including wikis, Slack logs, emails, and spreadsheets — through natural language, with accurate answers, citations, and tool-call simulations.

Built using **LangChain**, **Groq LLMs**, **FAISS**, and **Python**, this project represents a production-ready AI assistant that blends **semantic retrieval**, **enterprise security**, and **intelligent automation**.

### 🧩 Features
✅ Secure local RAG pipeline for enterprise data  
✅ Multi-source ingestion (PDFs, text, emails, spreadsheets, chat logs)  
✅ Citation-based answers for transparency  
✅ Tool-call simulation (e.g., “Schedule meeting”, “Lookup file”)  
✅ Interactive Gradio UI for user queries  
✅ Visual analytics dashboard (usage logs, query topics, response metrics)  
✅ 100% privacy — all data stays local

🚀 Usage

Launch the notebook in Google Colab.

Upload internal files (text, emails, wikis, etc.).

Ask natural language questions like:

- "Summarize all product launch updates from Slack."
- "What are the recent HR policy changes?"
- "Find the spreadsheet containing Q4 revenue."


The agent retrieves, summarizes, and cites relevant sources in real time.
